A crucial part of the proposed pipeline is to represent the obtained raw telemetry data in a way that abstracts the state of the network.
Deep neural networks have been used for non-dynamical graphs \cite{venkatakrishnan_graph2seq_2018}, where the structure of the graph is converted to a continous vector for each timestep.
We need a DNN that can also process the dynamical behaviour of our data into the graph.

Another possibility is to use the
